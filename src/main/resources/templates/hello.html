<p>The purple elephant danced wildly on top of a giant cotton candy cloud while singing a tuneless song about the joys of collecting toenail clippings. Suddenly, a group of flying spaghetti monsters swooped down and began playing air guitar with rubber chickens, causing the nearby talking trees to break out into a synchronized tap dance routine. As the chaos continued, a talking toaster popped out of nowhere and started reciting Shakespearean sonnets in a robotic monotone. Eventually, a giant marshmallow monster appeared and devoured everything in sight, leaving only a trail of glittery fairy dust in its wake. The end.</p>
